However, you may have heard us say that powder-based foundation is not ideal for skin with natural texture. (Powder foundation, blush, bronzer or eyeshadow can accentuate fine lines and wrinkles!)<br\/>If you’re planning to use a foundation, we suggest you choose one that's cream-based and matches your skin tone exactly. Apply a small amount to your face and compare it to the bare skin next to it. If you can’t tell the difference, you've found your match!<br\/>Here's how to use foundation with Boom products: Start with a moisturizer like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomsilk-product\" target=\"_blank\">Boomsilk<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomstick-glo\" target=\"_blank\">Boomstick Glo<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomcotton\" target=\"_blank\">Boom Cotton<\/a> as a primer. Then, after your moisturizer has had a few minutes to do its work, apply your foundation over it. To wear <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomstick-trio\" target=\"_blank\">Boomstick Trio<\/a> with foundation, dab on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomstick-glo\" target=\"_blank\">Boomstick Glo<\/a> first and allow to absorb for a few minutes. Next, apply your cream-based foundation and let it dry. Then, finish your look with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomstick-color\" target=\"_blank\">Boomstick Color<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boombycindyjoseph.com\/products\/boomstick-glimmer\" target=\"_self\">Boomstick Glimmer<\/a>.

Consult your physician. They might be caused by diet, allergies, lack of sleep—all kinds of things.<br\/>It’s funny because when our founder, Cindy Joseph, was a makeup artist in the 80s, she used to give her models dark circles on purpose! This smokey eye look was considered sexy—so you don’t have to feel bad about your dark circles!<br\/>But if you do want to hide them, we recommend you skip the concealer. It allows you to hide the circles, but you end up adding texture to your skin.<br\/>Instead, we suggest using a very light, creamy foundation.
